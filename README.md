<h2>How to run this on your machine</h2>
- Store environment variables on your computer with API keys to both OpenSky and Amadeus

- Also will need to request access from me for MongoDB

<h1>Main.py</h1>
- This portion of the project is everything that is seen in the demo

- It redirects to different templates in Flask

- Visualizes points that are stored in Mongo for flights asked for by user

- Starts to analyze the price and costs to see which flights should be located to different places

<h1>toMongoOpenSky.py</h1>
- This just retrieves historical flight paths from the OpenSky API and stores them in Mongo

- This is so that I can quickly retrieve the points from Mongo
